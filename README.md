# Basic LLM Module

Inspired by [Let's build GPT: from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), this is very basic LLM.

* Training data: input.txt (All Shakespeare work)
* Requirements: requirements.txt
* Run `main.py` to get output
* Once you train the data, it is loaded in `model.pth` after which training can be disabled and we can just run decoder
* This saves a lot of time, if you want to just play with decoder settings
